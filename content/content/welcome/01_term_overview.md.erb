#### Pilot and Term Projects
The course is organized around two team-based projects. 

**Pilot Projects** During the first 4 weeks all students, working in teams of five attack the "Pilot Project": Given a very brief vision statements, each team applies the Lean Startup framework to study and analyze the same product to figure out whether and how it should be formed into a company. This stage culminates in team presentations of findings.

**Term Projects** During the rest of the semester, all students work the "Term Project", a product of their invention. New teams of 4 students are formed. They again apply lean startup methodology, this time much more comprehensively to reach the end of the term with a solid plan, again culminating in presentations.
