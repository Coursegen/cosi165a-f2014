title: Homework info
---
#### General
* Every lecture has a lecture number.
* The homework due for a particular lecture is always listed at the top of the page for that day.
* When there is something to hand in it will be marked as a "deliverable"
* Some homework is designated "Team Deliverable:" which means that a single deliverable is due for the team and all team members get credit for it.

#### Handing in Homework
* All homework is handed in electronically as a post to Piazza
* If you want credit, you have to properly title your homework, as follows: Pito Salas 13-2 where 13 is the lecture number and 2 is the deliverable number within that lecture.
* It is due before class on that day. Talk to us if that poses a problem.
* Deadline for handing in homework is when the class starts. 
* If you need an exception you need to communicate the TA (not with Pito) (see <%= link_to_background :teachers %>) first. We will be reasonable.

#### Google Drive
* I will create a google drive folder and invite all students into it.
* Deliverables that are presentations or spreadsheets should be done in Google Docs and moved into the class google drive folder.
