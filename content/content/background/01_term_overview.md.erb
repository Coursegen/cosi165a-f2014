#### Pilot and Term Projects
The course is organized around two team-based projects. 

During the first 3 weeks all students, working in teams of five attack the "Pilot Project": Given a very brief vision statements, each team applies the Lean Startup framework to study and analyze the same product to figure out whether and how it should be formed into a company. This stage culminates in team presentations of findings.

During the rest of the semester, all students work the "Term Project", a product of their invention. New teams of 4 students are formed. They again apply lean startup methodology, this time much more comprehensively to reach the end of the term with a solid plan, again culminating in presentations.

#### High Level Overview

The semester is organized as follows:

* **Lean Startup Immersion** (Week 1, 2, 3) During the first three weeks we get to know each other and how the class will work. We will immerse ourselves in Lean Startup concepts and ideas. We will put them into immediate practice on a shared "Pilot Project" while working in teams. At the same time, we will begin brainstorming on the 'actual' products that we will be pursuing for the Term Project. 

* **Team Formation** (Week 4) All along you will have been thinking and exploring possible ideas for the Term Project. Figuring out what product or service you would like to propose. During this week we will see what everyone came up with, pick the best ones, and choose teams of 2 or 3 students to pursue the products. The work on these Term Projects will be the backbone of the rest of the semester culminating in a _Product Showcase_

* **Term Project Frame 1** (Week 5, 6, 7) During this frame the teams get themselves organized. Identify your key hypotheses and determine how to go about testing them. Prepare the artifacts needed to test the hypotheses and begin the process of "going out of the building."

* **Term Project Frame 2** (Week 8, 9, 10) During this frame the teams begin in earnest to determine how and whether to design and architect the product. You will be doing paper prototyping or using online prototyping tools, using these to test our _hypotheses_ by _going outside the building_. We also now consider our Engine of Growth and develop the financial model to test and validate.

* **Term Project Frame 3** (Week 11,12,13) During this final frame we pull everything together. Student teams refine their product business plans and prepare the final deliverables in preparation for the _Product Showcase_.
