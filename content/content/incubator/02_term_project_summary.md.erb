title: Project Summary Sheet
---
Each product or service proposed requires a term project summary. Depending on the stage you are at you may not have all the information yet. 

However before a team commits to a certain term project, and before the Frame 1 begins, the team needs to submit a completed Term Project Summary for approval. This is to help assure consistency, good preparation, and a reasonable choice of product.

The Term Project Summary will also tell you the general content of the final project report.

#### Team Info

* Product and Team name: which can be anything you want. Sometimes people just pick a code name like Team Alpha, and sometimes a descriptive name like Team Affective Tutor. You can always change it later.
* The team members (note: you can't supply this until the teams have been chosen)
* On a scale of 1(low)-10(high) how  excited are you about this?
* What aspects of the product or the process are interesting and exciting to you?

#### Product Summary

* A Tweet length (140 chars) summary of your project (product or service)
* Product Summary (1-2 paragraphs)

##### Hypotheses

* List the hypotheses, in priority order, and if validated so far, what the results were.

##### Value Proposition

* What can you say about what who the customer is, where you can find them, where they congregate?
* What is the problem is it solving? What is the "job" that your customer or user will hire this project to do for them? What are the Customer Pains it will relieve, or Gains it will produce?
* In what ways will it relieve those pains or provide those gains? What are the providers and relievers?
* What form will your solution take, how will it work, what will it do? How will it be delivered to customers?

##### Summaries

* Elevator Pitch as you might use for a non-technical business savvy person, for example a senior member of Brandeis administration
* Value proposition statement, using a 'sentence template' like we used in class
* Feel free to add anything else you think is relevant.
