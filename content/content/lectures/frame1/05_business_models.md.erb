* Business Model Canvas (by Alexander Osterwalter)
	* Watch this video introducing the concept by Alexander Osterwalder: [Tools for Business Model Generation](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2875). Pay *special attention* to this:
		* Try to understand really what is meant by the term **business model**. Think about how that applies to your product. Think about what a business built around it would work.
		* He organizes the space into nine **building blocks** And then illustrates a series of questions to think about in each block and start seeing the relationships between them. Try to really understand what each block is about and that you follow is example.
	* Divide up the Business Canvas 'building blocks' among your team, so each student will have two or three blocks.. Go back and listen again to the video with respect your block. Also you might do some web research about the block you are responsible for. 
	* <%= deliverable "Blog post with thoughts about your part of the business model" %>
* Term Project Teams:
	* Discuss and write down product feature stories. See <%= link_to_lecture :mockups_prototypes %> for a reminder on how to do them. Feature stories should be 1 sentence and fairly "granular." You should order them from most important to least important. It's ok if the later ones are not backed by a proven hypothesis, yet. But eventually and ideally all the stories should have such empirical backing.
	* <%= team_deliverable "Prioritized list of stories" %>
* Continue and complete your <%= link_to_topic :frame_1_report_peer_review %>. 
	* Create a write up of how you assessed the three considerations of the other team's product, and also summarizing what the other team and you heard in terms of feedback about your product. Make sure you include the team names and team member names. <%= team_deliverable "Peer review writeup" %>

#### Creating an MVP / Prototyping / Mockups
* <%= link_to_topic :mvp %>
* <%= link_to_topic :paper_prototyping %>
* Compare terms: MVP vs. prototype vs. mockup
* You need to be able to articulate exactly why you are creating a prototype
* Looks like vs. Works like
* Purpose of prototype dictates the medium and fidelity
* **Discussion:** for each product, what prototype/MVP should you be building now?
