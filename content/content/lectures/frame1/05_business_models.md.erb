<%= homework_hdr %>

* Business Model Canvas
	* Watch a video introducing the concept: [Tools for Business Model Generation](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2875)
	* Divide up the Business Canvas 'boxes' among your team
	* <%= deliverable "Blog post with thoughts about your part of the business model" %>
* Term Project Teams:
	* Discuss and write down product feature stories. See <%= link_to_lecture :quant_qual_test %> for a reminder on how to do them. Feature stories should be 1 sentence and fairly "granular." You should order them from most important to least important. It's ok if the later ones are not backed by a proven hypothesis, yet. But eventually and ideally all the stories should have such empirical backing.
	* <%= team_deliverable "Prioritized list of stories" %>
* Peer feedback notes from yesterday's classroom work.
  * <%= team_deliverable "A Piazza post divided into two sections. What feedback you gave the other team and what feedback you received." %>
