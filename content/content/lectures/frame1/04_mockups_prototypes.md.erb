---
<%= homework_hdr %>

* Read: "The Lean Startup", Chapter 10. *Prepare for a discussion in class!*
* Read [this article about about principles for a clean visual design](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.visualmess.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzful-D3sxjhshl5o_AlDsoz20YtvQ)
	* Select two of the principles and find two examples of web sites or mobile apps that VIOLATE those principles. <%= deliverable "2-5 paragraph blog post, with images, explaining the two principles in your own words, showing the examples that you found, and explaining why they violated the principles." %>
* Sketches of the two most important screens in your app
	* Work independently to see how different ideas come out!
	* Try to use some of the principles from the article above
	* Think about colors, placement of items, alignment, balance and so on. 
	* You can use any tool(s) you want - pencil and paper, watercolors, photoshop. 
	* Be neat and clear but you don't get extra credit for being super fancy
	* <%= deliverable "Post the two images. We will review them together in class." %>
* Get together with your team for 1-2 hours at least
  * Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. <%= team_deliverable "Post revision 0.3 of your Frame 1 Report" %>

#### Discussion
* Review homeworks
* Discuss Chapter 10 of The Lean Startup

<%= include_topic :user_stories %>

#### Peer Feedback sessions
* Read the other team's Draft 0.2 of Frame 1 Report
* Have a discussion and constructive criticism
* Be open minded!
* Reviewee and reviewer teams: Listen carefully and take notes
* Consider:
  * Effort/Seriousness of purpose; How well is the team thinking in a Lean Startup way
  * How can their product be improved? How can it be made "bigger"? Try not to focus only on little details
* Take 30 minutes; maybe one group go to Vertical Lounge; 15 minute for each product.
* Homework for next class will be to write up what you said (to other team) and what you heard (from other team)


#### Creating an MVP / Prototyping / Mockups
* <%= link_to_topic :mvp %>
* <%= link_to_topic :paper_prototyping %>
* Compare terms: MVP vs. prototype vs. mockup
* You need to be able to articulate exactly why you are creating a prototype
* Looks like vs. Works like
* Purpose of prototype dictates the medium and fidelity
* **Discussion:** for each product, what prototype/MVP should you be building now?

##### Next Class
* Last one before presentations!
* <%= link_to_lecture :business_models %>
