<%= homework_hdr %>

	* Select two of the principles and find two examples of web sites or mobile apps that VIOLATE those principles. <%= deliverable "2-5 paragraph blog post, with images, explaining the two principles in your own words, showing the examples that you found, and explaining why they violated the principles." %>
* Sketches of the two most important screens in your app
	* Work independently to see how different ideas come out!
	* Try to use some of the principles from the article above
	* Think about colors, placement of items, alignment, balance and so on. 
	* You can use any tool(s) you want - pencil and paper, watercolors, photoshop. 
	* Be neat and clear but you don't get extra credit for being super fancy
	* <%= deliverable "Post the two images. We will review them together in class." %>
* *Term Project teams:* Continue to work on your hypotheses.

#### Discussion
* Review homeworks
* Discuss Chapter 10 of The Lean Startup

<%= include_topic :user_stories %>

#### Peer Feedback sessions
* Read the other team's Draft 0.2 of Frame 1 Report
* Have a discussion and constructive criticism
* Be open minded!
* Reviewee and reviewer teams: Listen carefully and take notes
* Consider:
  * Effort/Seriousness of purpose; How well is the team thinking in a Lean Startup way
  * How can their product be improved? How can it be made "bigger"? Try not to focus only on little details
* Take 30 minutes; maybe one group go to Vertical Lounge; 15 minute for each product.
* Homework for next class will be to write up what you said (to other team) and what you heard (from other team)


##### Creating an MVP / Prototyping / Mockups
* <%= link_to_topic :mvp %>
* Compare terms: MVP vs. prototype vs. mockup
* You need to be able to articulate exactly why you are creating a prototype
* Looks like vs. Works like
* Purpose of prototype dictates the medium and fidelity
* **Discussion:** for each product, what prototype/MVP should you be building now?
