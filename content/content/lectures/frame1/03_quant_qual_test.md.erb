1. Linkedin Groups: Locate a linkedin group that might have useful feedback on some of your hypotheses. Compose an email question that you would send to them expecting an answer. *Prepare to explain it in class!*
1. Go out of the building! Each member of each product team should take some hypotheses off the list to test outside the building. <%= deliverable "Write a blog post describing the several hypotheses that you tested, how you did it and what the results were." %>
1. Get together with your project team, spending 1-2 hours together
	* Review <%= link_to_topic :frame_1_report %>.
	* Update your Frame 1 report, as necessary. Add more information about hypotheses, and tests you've done. Review you what you wrote in Draft 0.1. Do you still agree with what's written in tweet-length description? Can you improve it? Can you improve the product summary? Aligment is important!
	* <%= team_deliverable "Draft 0.2 of Frame 1 Report." %>

#### Peer Feedback sessions
* Read the other team's Draft 0.2 of Frame 1 Report
* Have a discussion and constructive criticism
* Be open minded!
* Reviewee and reviewer teams: Listen carefully and take notes
* Consider:
	* Effort/Seriousness of purpose; How well is the team thinking in a Lean Startup way
	* How can their product be improved? How can it be made "bigger"? Try not to focus only on little details
* Take 30 minutes; maybe one group go to Vertical Lounge; 15 minute for each product.
* Homework for next class will be to write up what you said (to other team) and what you heard (from other team)

#### Hypotheses and testing

* <%= discussion "Hypotheses for your term products product" %>
	* Where are you keeping them? Give me the URL so we can all look at them
	* What are some characteristics of a well stated hypothesis?
	* Let's discuss "technology" hypotheses and their role at this stage
	* How exactly could we test it qualitatively?
	* How exactly could we test it quantitatively?
	* Repeat for some more hypotheses
