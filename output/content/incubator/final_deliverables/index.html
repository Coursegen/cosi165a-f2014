          <h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>

<p>This is a team, multi-part deliverable. You should start looking at this at the start of the Term Project part of the course so you know what you are working towards. It will account for 20% of your grade (see <a href="/content/background/02_grading/">Grading</a>) Don’t be scared by all the words below, I am just trying to be clear and detailed. Questions are welcome! </p>

<p>Remember, 9 out of 10 startups fail. It is not expected that each project yields something that merits investment. The important things are the journey, the process, and what you learned that will help you be a better entrepreneur.</p>

<h5 id="final-presentation-day">Final Presentation Day</h5>

<p>On <strong>December 12, between 1:30 and 4:00pm</strong> we will have final presentations. Several Outside Experts (tm) will be invited to listen to each team do their presentations, ask questions, and have one on one conversations while we munch on snacks and drink delicious beverages. </p>

<p>The Experts will ask to review the projects as if they were looking for angel funding. The review will not be based solely on the formal presentation but also from looking at additional materials that you might have (see below.) So not all the criteria need to be packed into the presentation. Some can be in the form of handouts or a poster or a demo on your computer.</p>

<p>Like for Frame 1, they will be given a form to fill out with their numeric feedback and additional comments. The experts feedback will be factored into your eventual grade. </p>

<h5 id="what-we-will-be-looking-at">What we will be looking at</h5>

<p>Here are some of the criteria that we will be looking at. NB: not all these topics have to be covered in the presentation, they might be relegated to the handout.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the idea itself, with an elevator pitch and positioning/value prop</li>
  <li>how well you understanding the market and the customer</li>
  <li>summary of top hypotheses that were tested and the results thereof</li>
  <li>how much you learned by getting outside the building</li>
  <li>how well you have addressed the biggest and riskiest hypotheses</li>
  <li>your thinking about the pricing and business model</li>
  <li>your thinking about the feature set (stories)</li>
  <li>your thinking about the user experience (paper prototype, ux flow, mockups, etc.)</li>
  <li>your thinking about the feature set/stories for the product and the technical architecture</li>
  <li>your ability to deliver the product if it were funded</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You should consider using the Business Model Canvas structure as the outline of either your presentation or your handout or both. This is just a suggestion. Here it is: <a href="/content/topics/business/business_model_canvas/">Business Model Canvas</a></strong></p>

<h5 id="specific-deliverables">Specific Deliverables</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A 10 minute presentation. Will be delivered by all the students on a team. The presentation needs to be rehearsed and fit to the time constraint. Questions will be held to the end, and will go for up to 10 minutes. You can think of the audience as angel investors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Slides for the presentation. These should be stored in the shared google drive and also printed out to be handed out to the guests. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Handout/Paper/Report with additional information (5-10 pages.) You could consider following the same organization as your presentation, but with more detail. For example larger screenshots or a more complete list of stories. You can assume that whoever reads it also has the presentation slides. You can think of the audience for this piece to also be angel investors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ad or Brochure or Flyer for your product (1 page. 2-sided if you want. Color. Pretty.) This is pure marketing. How do you want to convince your customer to adopt your product? If your product has two distinct customes, e.g. University Admin and Students, then it’s ok to have two Ads if you feel you need it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="finally">Finally</h5>

<p>One the last day of class, all 4 teams should have a alpha-version of their presentation and handouts. We will look them over and provide feedback. </p>

<p>Also there will be food.</p>
